Disease,Description
Fungal infection,"Mycoses, another name for fungal infections, are fungal-caused illnesses that can impact the skin, nails, mucous membranes, or internal organs.  These infections can be superficial (like ringworm and athlete's foot) or systemic (like aspergillosis or candidiasis), and they can be fatal, especially in people with compromised immune systems.  Common causes include fungi including Dermatophytes, Aspergillus, Candida, and Cryptococcus.  Itching, redness, swelling, and exhaustion are common symptoms, however they might vary based on the type and location of the infection.  Imaging, laboratory testing, or physical examination are all used in the diagnosis process.  In order to avoid recurrence, treatment usually consists of systemic or topical antifungal drugs as well as lifestyle and hygiene changes."
Allergy,"An allergy occurs when the immune system overreacts to a chemical, known as an allergen, that is typically safe for most people.  Pollen, dust mites, pet dander, some foods (such as peanuts or shellfish), insect stings, and pharmaceuticals are examples of common allergies.  Chemicals like histamine are released by the immune system in response to allergen exposure, resulting in symptoms including sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, watery eyes, or even more serious reactions like anaphylaxis.  Allergies can impact the digestive tract, skin, respiratory system, or body as a whole.  Blood tests, skin prick tests, or medical history are used to make the diagnosis.  Antihistamines, corticosteroids, avoiding allergens, and in extreme situations, carrying an epinephrine auto-injector are all part of the treatment.  Over time, allergen immunotherapy may also aid in lowering sensitivity."
GERD,"Acid from the stomach often refluxes into the esophagus, irritating its lining, in GERD, a persistent digestive ailment.  Acid reflux is the term for this backflow, which results in symptoms including heartburn, chest pain, food or sour liquid regurgitation, difficulty swallowing, and a chronic cough.  The lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a ring of muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach, weakens or relaxes improperly, resulting in GERD.  Obesity, pregnancy, smoking, specific meals, and drugs are examples of common risk factors.  Symptoms, endoscopy, pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry are used to make the diagnosis.  Medications like antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), dietary adjustments (such as diet and weight loss), and in extreme situations, surgery (such as fundoplication) are all part of the treatment."
Chronic cholestasis,"Bile acids accumulate in the liver and blood as a result of chronic cholestasis, a chronic illness in which the passage of bile from the liver to the intestine is diminished or obstructed.  Itching, jaundice, dark urine, pale feces, and exhaustion are some of the symptoms that may result from this.  It could be brought on by autoimmune and genetic problems, certain drugs, or liver diseases such hepatitis or primary biliary cholangitis.  Liver function tests, imaging, and occasionally biopsy are used in the diagnosis process.  In extreme situations, liver transplantation may be necessary in addition to symptom management and the use of drugs such as ursodeoxycholic acid.



"
Drug Reaction,"An undesirable or dangerous reaction to a medication is known as a drug reaction.  It can cause everything from minor symptoms like rashes, nausea, or lightheadedness to serious consequences including liver damage, anaphylaxis, or skin conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  medicine reactions can be either non-allergic, which is caused by the chemical effects of the medicine, or allergic, which is caused by the immune system.  Age, genetics, pre-existing medical disorders, and the usage of several drugs are risk factors.  Medical history, symptom patterns, and occasionally allergy testing are used to make the diagnosis.  Drug cessation, symptom management, and, in extreme situations, emergency care and the use of substitute pharmaceuticals are all part of treatment.

"
Peptic ulcer disease,"Open sores that form on the stomach's inner lining or the upper portion of the small intestine are a symptom of peptic ulcer disease.  Long-term usage of NSAIDs like ibuprofen or Helicobacter pylori infections are the most common causes.  Burning stomach discomfort, bloating, nausea, and in extreme situations, vomiting blood or black stools, are some of the symptoms.  Stress, alcohol consumption, smoking, and spicy foods are risk factors.  Endoscopy, breathalyzer tests, or stool testing are used to make the diagnosis.  Antibiotics (for H. pylori), drugs that lower stomach acid, and lifestyle modifications are all part of the treatment to encourage recovery and stop recurrence."
AIDS,"The advanced stage of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection, known as AIDS, is characterized by a significantly compromised immune system that is unable to fend against infections and illnesses.  It is passed from mother to child during childbirth or lactation, as well as through blood, semen, and vaginal secretions.  Rapid weight loss, a prolonged fever, exhaustion, enlarged lymph nodes, and opportunistic infections are typical symptoms.  Blood tests that identify HIV antibodies or viral load are used to make the diagnosis.  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can contain the infection, extend life, and stop the progression of AIDS, but there is no cure.  The condition must be managed with early detection and regular medication."
Diabetes,"Diabetes is a long-term illness characterized by elevated blood sugar levels caused by either insufficient insulin production or inefficient insulin utilization.  The three primary forms are gestational diabetes (during pregnancy), Type 2 (insulin resistance), and Type 1 (autoimmune, insulin-dependent).  Frequent urination, increased thirst, exhaustion, hazy eyesight, and sluggish wound healing are typical symptoms.  Long-term issues may include the kidneys, nerves, eyes, and heart.  Blood tests such as HbA1c and fasting glucose are used to make the diagnosis.  Depending on the kind and degree, management may involve medication, insulin therapy, blood sugar monitoring, or lifestyle modifications."
Gastroenteritis,"An inflammation of the stomach and intestines, gastroenteritis is typically brought on by bacterial or viral illnesses.  Symptoms include cramping in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally fever.  Contact with an infected person or contaminated food or drink are common causes.  Although it is frequently temporary, it can cause dehydration, particularly in small children and the elderly.  Although stool tests may be performed in extreme circumstances, the diagnosis is typically made clinically based on symptoms.  Remaining hydrated, getting enough sleep, and occasionally using medicine to cure the infection or reduce symptoms are the mainstays of treatment."
Bronchial Asthma,"Episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, often at night or in the early morning, are symptoms of bronchial asthma, a chronic inflammatory illness of the airways.  Allergens, physical activity, chilly air, pollutants, and respiratory illnesses can all cause it.  The disorder is brought on by inflammation and muscle tightness, which cause the airways to constrict and become hyperresponsive.  Lung function tests such as spirometry and bronchodilator responsiveness are part of the diagnosis.  In order to manage inflammation, treatment entails avoiding triggers, utilizing inhalers (corticosteroids and bronchodilators), and taking long-term drugs.  Most people with asthma can have normal, active lives if their condition is well managed."
Hypertension,"Blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg is commonly used to describe hypertension, a chronic condition in which the force of blood against the artery walls is continuously too high.  It is frequently referred to as a ""silent killer"" because, despite the possibility of exhibiting no symptoms, it raises the risk of kidney damage, heart disease, stroke, and other consequences.  Genetics, obesity, excessive salt consumption, stress, inactivity, and underlying medical disorders are some of the causes.  Blood pressure is regularly monitored in order to make the diagnosis.  Management includes stress reduction, medication to keep blood pressure within a normal range, and lifestyle modifications (healthy diet, exercise, and less salt).

"
Migraine,"A neurological condition known as migraine is typified by recurrent, severe headaches that are frequently accompanied by light or sound sensitivity, nausea, and vomiting.  One side of the head is typically affected by the throbbing ache.  Before the headache, some persons get a ""aura"" that could include tingling or vision abnormalities.  Stress, particular diets, hormone fluctuations, sleep deprivation, and environmental variables are a few examples of triggers.  Clinical history and symptom patterns are used to make the diagnosis.  Treatment consists of preventive drugs, lifestyle modifications to lessen the frequency of attacks, and pain management (analgesics, triptans)."
Cervical spondylosis,"Age-related wear and tear on the cervical spine (neck area), including the joints and intervertebral discs, is known as cervical spondylosis.  Due to nerve compression, it can cause stiffness, headaches, neck pain, and in certain situations, numbness or weakness in the hands and arms.  Poor posture, previous neck injuries, and degenerative changes are common reasons.  Age and a sedentary lifestyle raise risk.  A physical examination, X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans are used to make the diagnosis.  Painkillers, physical therapy, neck exercises, and, in extreme situations, surgery to relieve nerve pressure are all part of the treatment."
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"When a blood vessel in the brain bursts, bleeding affects surrounding brain tissue, resulting in paralysis.  Along with symptoms like abrupt weakness, disorientation, trouble speaking, loss of balance, or unconsciousness, this might result in hemiplegia, or the loss of muscular function or movement on one side of the body.  Blood diseases, head injuries, aneurysms, and excessive blood pressure are common reasons.  CT or MRI scans are used to confirm the diagnosis.  In order to control problems, lower brain pressure, and halt the bleeding, treatment entails emergency care.  Recovery requires rehabilitation, which includes speech and physical therapy."
Jaundice,"Yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes as a result of high blood bilirubin levels is known as jaundice.  It is frequently brought on by bile duct blockage, excessive red blood cell breakdown, or liver illnesses such as cirrhosis or hepatitis.  Fatigue, pale stools, dark urine, yellow skin and eyes, and stomach pain are some possible symptoms.  To determine the underlying reason, diagnostic procedures include imaging scans, liver function testing, and blood tests.  Depending on the underlying reason, treatment options may include medication, lifestyle modifications, or surgery for severe liver damage or obstruction."
Malaria,"Plasmodium parasites cause malaria, an infectious disease spread by mosquito bites from infected Anopheles mosquitoes.  High fever, chills, sweating, headaches, muscle aches, and exhaustion are some of the usual symptoms.  If treatment is delayed, severe cases may result in anemia, organ failure, or even death.  Tropical and subtropical regions are where the disease is most prevalent.  Blood tests are used to identify the parasite and make the diagnosis.  Artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs), supportive care, and antimalarial drugs like chloroquine are also part of the treatment.  In high-risk areas, prevention measures include bed nets, insect repellents, mosquito control, and preventative drugs."
Chicken pox,"The varicella-zoster virus is the cause of chickenpox, a highly contagious virus.  It mainly affects youngsters and is characterized by fever, exhaustion, and appetite loss, as well as an itchy skin rash with red spots and blisters filled with fluid.  Direct touch or airborne droplets from sneezing or coughing are the two ways that the virus spreads.  Although the majority of instances are benign, adults, expectant mothers, and those with compromised immune systems may experience consequences.  The rash and symptoms are typically used to make the diagnosis.  Antihistamines, fever reducers, and skin care are the mainstays of treatment.  The most effective method of preventing chickenpox is vaccination."
Dengue,"Aedes mosquitoes carry the dengue virus, which causes dengue, a virus that is spread by mosquitoes.  It causes a high fever, excruciating headache, rash, joint and muscle discomfort, pain behind the eyes, and moderate bleeding (such as bleeding from the nose or gums).  In extreme situations, it may develop into potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.  In tropical and subtropical areas, it is widespread.  Blood tests that identify the virus or antibodies are used to make the diagnosis.  The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, which includes fever control, rest, and fluids.  Avoiding mosquito bites and managing mosquito breeding grounds are two aspects of prevention."
Typhoid,"Salmonella typhi is the bacterium that causes typhoid, which is typically contracted by tainted food or water.  Prolonged high temperature, weakness, headaches, nausea, and occasionally a rash are typical symptoms.  Serious side effects like intestinal bleeding or perforation may result if treatment is not received.  Tests on bone marrow, feces, or blood are used to confirm the diagnosis.  Antibiotics, relaxation, and fluids are all part of the treatment.  Vaccination, safe food and water habits, and proper hygiene are key preventive measures, particularly while visiting high-risk locations."
hepatitis A,"The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the cause of hepatitis A, a contagious liver infection that is usually contracted by intimate contact with an infected person or by consuming contaminated food or drink.  Fatigue, nausea, dark urine, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and loss of appetite are some of the symptoms.  Although it rarely progresses to chronic liver disease, it can occasionally be rather severe.  Blood tests are used to make the diagnosis.  The main goals of treatment are symptom alleviation, rest, and hydration.  Vaccination, healthy food practices, and proper cleanliness are all part of prevention.

"
Hepatitis B,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the cause of hepatitis B, a dangerous liver illness.  Contact with contaminated blood, semen, or other bodily fluids—typically through shared needles, unprotected intercourse, or mother-to-child transmission after childbirth—is how it is disseminated.  Fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, joint pain, nausea, and abdominal pain are some possible symptoms.  Some people recover completely, while others get persistent infections that raise their risk of cancer or liver cirrhosis.  Blood tests that look for HBV markers are used to make the diagnosis.  For chronic instances, treatment consists of antiviral drugs and ongoing observation.  Effective immunization and safe procedures can help prevent."
Hepatitis C,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the primary cause of hepatitis C, a liver infection that is mainly contracted by coming into contact with contaminated blood, frequently through shared needles, risky medical procedures, or, less frequently, sexual contact.  Early on, many people don't exhibit any symptoms, but over time, a persistent infection can cause cirrhosis, liver damage, or liver cancer.  When symptoms do show up, they could include nausea, dark urine, jaundice, exhaustion, and abdominal pain.  Blood tests that identify viral RNA and HCV antibodies are used to confirm the diagnosis.  The majority of cases can be cured with treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs.  Since there is no vaccination, prevention consists of avoiding contact with blood and adopting safe behaviors."
Hepatitis D,"Only those who have already contracted hepatitis B can get hepatitis D, a liver infection brought on by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B for replication.  Like hepatitis B, it is spread by coming into touch with contaminated blood or bodily fluids.  Fatigue, jaundice, joint and stomach discomfort, and nausea are some of the symptoms.  More severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis and liver failure, can result from co-infection or superinfection with hepatitis B.  Blood tests that identify HDV antibodies or RNA are used to make the diagnosis.  Although there isn't a specific antiviral treatment, liver health monitoring and hepatitis B control are crucial.  The hepatitis B vaccine is the preventative measure."
Hepatitis E,"The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the cause of hepatitis E, a liver infection that is usually contracted by tainted food or water.  In places with inadequate sanitation, it is more prevalent.  Fatigue, jaundice, stomach ache, fever, nausea, and black urine are some of the symptoms.  Although the illness normally goes away on its own in a few weeks, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems may experience severe symptoms.  Blood tests that identify viral RNA or HEV antibodies are used to make the diagnosis.  Rest, fluids, and supportive care are the mainstays of management; there is no particular antiviral medication.  Sanitation, hygiene, and clean water are essential for prevention."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Over time, excessive alcohol usage can lead to the inflammatory liver disease known as alcoholic hepatitis.  It causes symptoms like fever, nausea, loss of appetite, jaundice, exhaustion, and stomach pain, particularly in the upper right side.  In extreme situations, it may develop into cirrhosis or liver failure.  Heavy drinking over time raises the risk.  Imaging, liver function tests, physical examination, and medical history are used to make the diagnosis.  Treatment includes stopping alcohol as away, getting nutritional support, using drugs to lessen inflammation in the liver, and sometimes taking corticosteroids.  Monitoring liver function and avoiding alcohol are key components of long-term care.

"
Tuberculosis,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a communicable bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs but can also spread to other organs.  When an infected individual coughs or sneezes, airborne droplets are released into the air, spreading the infection.  Fatigue, fever, night sweats, chest pain, and a persistent cough—often with blood—are typical symptoms.  Both latent (inactive) and active TB are possible.  Sputum analysis, skin tests, and chest X-rays are used in the diagnosis process.  A lengthy course of antibiotics, such as isoniazid and rifampicin, is necessary for treatment; this course often lasts six months.  BCG immunization and early identification and treatment of active patients are examples of preventive interventions."
Common Cold,"Rhinoviruses are the primary cause of the common cold, a mild and infectious viral infection of the upper respiratory tract.  It spreads via touching contaminated surfaces, direct contact, or airborne droplets.  Sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, headache, and exhaustion are some of the symptoms.  after the absence of medical intervention, it normally goes away after 7–10 days.  Symptoms are used to make the diagnosis, and rest, water, decongestants, and painkillers are used to alleviate discomfort.  Maintaining a strong immune system, avoiding close contact with infected people, and practicing proper hand hygiene are all part of prevention.

"
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection brought on by bacteria, viruses, or fungus that causes inflammation of the air sacs in one or both lungs.  Symptoms including coughing (frequently with phlegm), fever, chills, chest pain, and trouble breathing can result from the air sacs filling with fluid or pus.  Particularly in young children, the elderly, or those with compromised immune systems, it can vary in severity.  A physical examination, chest X-rays, and blood or sputum testing are all part of the diagnosis process.  Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial pneumonia, antivirals for viral types, and antifungals for fungus pneumonia.  Oxygen therapy, drinks, and rest could also be required.  Prevention is aided by vaccination."
Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Swollen and inflammatory veins in the rectum and anus, which can be internal or external, are referred to as dimorphic hemorrhoids, or piles.  Particularly during or after bowel motions, they cause pain, discomfort, itching, and rectal bleeding.  Chronic constipation, extended sitting, straining during bowel movements, a low-fiber diet, and pregnancy are risk factors.  Physical examination and, if necessary, techniques such as anoscopy are used to make the diagnosis.  Warm sitz baths, topical treatments, stool softeners, increased water intake, and high-fiber foods are all part of the treatment.  Surgery or rubber band ligation may be required in extreme situations.  Recurrence can be avoided by altering one's lifestyle."
Heart attack,"A myocardial infarction, often known as a heart attack, happens when blood supply to a portion of the heart is interrupted, typically by a blood clot, causing damage to the heart muscle.  Coronary artery disease is frequently the cause of it.  Sweating, nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath, pain radiating to the arm, neck, or jaw, and chest pain or pressure are typical symptoms.  Getting medical help right away is essential.  Imaging, blood tests (such as troponin), and ECG are used in the diagnosis process.  Treatment options include surgery (bypass), angioplasty, and drugs (aspirin, clot busters).  A healthy lifestyle, frequent checkups, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and quitting smoking are all part of prevention."
Varicose veins,"Large, twisted veins known as varicose veins are frequently found in the legs as a result of weak or damaged vein valves that interfere with regular blood flow.  They frequently have a blue or dark purple appearance and can make the legs hurt, swell, feel heavy, or spasm.  The risk is increased by age, pregnancy, obesity, and prolonged standing.  Usually, a physical examination and Doppler ultrasound are used to make the diagnosis.  Compression stockings, exercise, leg elevation, and lifestyle modifications are used to treat mild instances.  Surgery, laser therapy, or sclerotherapy may be necessary for severe instances.  A healthy weight, frequent activity, and avoiding extended periods of sitting or standing are all components of preventive care.

"
Hypothyroidism,"A slow metabolism results from hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones.  Fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, depression, cold intolerance, and slower heart rate are typical symptoms.  Thyroid surgery, iodine shortage, autoimmune illnesses (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and some drugs can all contribute to it.  Blood tests that measure TSH and thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4) are used to confirm the diagnosis.  Levothyroxine is typically used as part of regular thyroid hormone replacement therapy.  Effective management of the illness requires routine monitoring and medication adjustments."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces excess thyroid hormones, speeding up the body’s metabolism. Common symptoms include weight loss, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, irritability, tremors, sweating, heat intolerance, and increased appetite. It may be caused by Graves’ disease, thyroid nodules, or excessive iodine intake. Diagnosis involves blood tests showing low TSH and high T3/T4 levels, and sometimes thyroid scans. Treatment options include antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine therapy, or surgery to remove part of the thyroid. Regular follow-up is essential to manage hormone levels and prevent complications."
Hypoglycemia,"A condition known as hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar (glucose) levels fall below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL.  It frequently happens to diabetics as a result of taking too much insulin, missing meals, or engaging in extreme exercise.  Shaking, perspiration, lightheadedness, hunger, disorientation, agitation, fast heartbeat, and in extreme situations, unconsciousness or seizures, are some of the symptoms.  Consuming fast-acting carbs, such as glucose pills, fruit juice, or candies, is part of immediate treatment.  Regular monitoring and appropriate medication management help diabetics avoid crises.  It has to be evaluated by a doctor because it can be connected to other health problems in non-diabetics."
Osteoarthristis,"The protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones eventually deteriorates in osteoarthritis, a persistent joint disease.  The knees, hips, hands, and spine are the most frequently affected areas.  Joint discomfort, stiffness (particularly after inactivity), edema, and decreased flexibility are some of the symptoms.  It occurs as people age and can be exacerbated by genetics, obesity, past injuries, and excessive joint use.  Physical examinations, X-rays, and occasionally MRIs are used in the diagnosis process.  Exercise, weight control, painkillers, physical therapy, and, in extreme situations, joint replacement surgery are all used in treatment to reduce symptoms and enhance joint function.

"
Arthritis,"Conditions that result in joint stiffness, discomfort, and inflammation are collectively referred to as arthritis.  The two most prevalent kinds are rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease, and osteoarthritis, which is brought on by wear and tear.  Joint discomfort, swelling, stiffness, and decreased range of motion are among the symptoms, particularly in the morning or after rest.  It can deteriorate with age and impact one or more joints.  Physical examinations, blood testing, and imaging such as X-rays are all part of the diagnosis process.  Physical therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, painkillers, lifestyle modifications, and even surgery are all part of the treatment.  Joint function and quality of life can both be enhanced by early diagnosis and treatment."
(vertigo) Paroymsal Positional Vertigo,"BPPV is a common inner ear condition that is brought on by changes in head position and causes abrupt, brief episodes of vertigo, or a spinning sensation.  It happens when little calcium crystals in the inner ear come loose and enter the semicircular canals, interfering with the brain's ability to receive balance signals.  Dizziness, nausea, unsteadiness, and a whirling sensation while turning the head or gazing up or down are some of the symptoms.  Although it can interfere with everyday tasks, it is not life-threatening.  Certain head movement tests, such as the Dix-Hallpike test, are used to make the diagnosis.  Repositioning techniques, including the Epley maneuver, are frequently used in treatment to return the crystals to their correct position."
Acne,"When oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria block hair follicles, acne, a common skin disorder, develops.  It typically shows up on the shoulders, back, chest, and face.  Cysts, pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads are common varieties.  Acne can be brought on or made worse by hormonal changes (particularly during adolescence), stress, food, and some drugs.  Mild patches to severe inflammation and scarring are among the symptoms.  Physical examination is the basis for diagnosis.  Hormonal medication, oral antibiotics, topical treatments (such as retinoids or benzoyl peroxide), and skincare practices are all part of the treatment.  Flare-ups can be avoided by keeping skin clean and avoiding harsh chemicals."
Urinary tract infection,"Any bacterial infection that affects the bladder, urethra, ureters, or kidneys is known as a urinary tract infection (UTI).  Women are more likely to have it.  Strong urges to urinate, burning when urinating, murky or unpleasant-smelling urine, pelvic pain, and frequent, light urination are some of the symptoms.  It can spread to the kidneys and result in major consequences if left untreated.  Urine tests are used to make the diagnosis.  Usually, treatment consists of taking antibiotics and drinking more water.  Maintaining proper cleanliness, urinating after sexual activity, and drinking plenty of water are preventive methods."
Psoriasis,"Usually found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back, psoriasis is a persistent inflammatory skin condition that results in a rapid accumulation of skin cells and thick, red, scaly areas.  In addition to being uncomfortable and itchy, it can occasionally bleed or crack.  Although the precise etiology is unknown, environmental stressors such as stress, illnesses, or cold weather, heredity, and immune system dysfunction are all involved.  Plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic psoriasis are among the types.  Skin inspection and occasionally a biopsy are used to make the diagnosis.  In order to lessen inflammation and limit the proliferation of skin cells, treatment involves topical creams, phototherapy, and systemic drugs."
Impetigo,"The most common bacterial skin illness in young children is impetigo, which is extremely contagious.  It typically manifests as red blisters or sores that burst and produce a yellowish-brown crust around the mouth, nose, hands, and feet.  It is transferred by direct contact or shared objects like toys or towels and is brought on by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus.  Based on appearance, the bacteria may be confirmed by laboratory testing.  Antibiotics are applied topically or taken orally.  It can be stopped from spreading by practicing good hygiene, cleaning wounds, and avoiding close contact with sick people."
